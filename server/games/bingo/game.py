"""Classic 75-ball Bingo.

Standard American Bingo: each player gets an independently-shuffled 5x5
card (columns B-I-N-G-O, free center space), the game calls one number
at a time from the full 1-75 pool at a configurable interval, and
players mark their card as numbers are called. The first player to
claim a valid pattern wins.

Unlike turn-based games, Bingo has no concept of "whose turn it is" --
every active player can mark their card and claim Bingo at any time
during play. This mirrors the structure used by Color Game, where
``set_turn_players`` registers the active roster once at start but the
turn action set is available to every player simultaneously, gated by
game phase rather than a current player.

# When a player claims Bingo, the game holds the result behind a drum-roll
# suspense beat before revealing whether the claim is valid, instead of
# resolving it instantly. suspense.ogg is now JUST the roll (2.51s of
# actual content, no trailing silence) -- the cymbal crash that used to
# be baked into the end of that file is now its own separate sound,
# cymbal.ogg, with an essentially instant attack (already loud within
# ~50ms of its own start). That split means the reveal no longer has to
# guess where a mid-file hit lands or compensate for TTS startup
# latency against it: the game just waits out the roll's own measured
# duration, then plays cymbal.ogg and speaks the result in the same
# instant -- the same "fire together, zero delay" trick the Dead Man's
# Deck gunshot/empty-chamber reveal uses, which works precisely because
# cymbal.ogg's hit is at its own sample 0, not somewhere mid-clip.
#
# This whole beat runs as a sequence (CLAIM_SEQUENCE_TAG) that owns the
# table's gameplay lock and pauses bots: the card is actually verified
# inside the resolution callback, not when the claim is first submitted,
# so nothing can be marked, unmarked, or claimed by anyone else while a
# claim is being checked, and there is no window where the verified

# sequence: Table.reset_game() calls cancel_all_sequences() on the old
# game instance the moment finish_game() installs a fresh one, which
# would silently swallow a sequence-based delay before its second beat
# ever ran. scheduled_sounds is the one piece of in-flight game state
